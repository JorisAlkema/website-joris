August 2025 I went on solo motorcycle vacation to Norway for 8 days. While I did document this on Polarsteps, I myself really prefer anything in plain-text format. It will mostly be a travel blog, with a short list of tips (derived from faults I made) for (any) motorcycle trip.

**Roads**
I got some insider tips from someone I met in Hirthals who lives in Hagesund. Which totally changed my experience. In no specific order:
- The E39 from Kristiansand to Stavanger is quite boring, But really fast. When going back home, you can consider taking the Stavanger - Hirthals ferry to skip riding it twice.
- I did not do the detour to the Lysebotn route, which I still regret. It looks stunning from the pictures I have seen.
- Don't drive the E39 from Stavanger to Bergen. Take the 13 via Odda instead. Much more scenic.
- Don't take the ferry at kinsarvik, but take the Hardangerbrua.
- I took the 7 from Bergen to Voss, which is quite nice. But the E16 is probably better.

**Preikestolen** I did the ["famous"](https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/fjord-norway/ryfylke/the-lysefjord-area/hiking-to-preikestolen/) hike and wanted to give the following remarks. 

- If you are in good cardiovascular shape, this hike will be very easy. Can be done on sneakers. I have even seen people carrying hiking pole's, which is nonsense.
- Can be done in 3hrs with a 45min break at the top.
- Parking is very expensive, cheaper for motorcycles. The amenities are very nice, so I don't mind it.

Even if you're not going on any sort of hiking vacation, but are in the area, I would still recommend it. Other hikes such as
- Kjeragbolten
- Besseggen Ridge
- Trolltunga

Are all considerably more challenging and need some planning. Preikestolen gets you 80% of the fun, for 20% of the work :)

Finally, without any specific order, a list of mistakes I made on this vacation because I was young (just turned 22) and stupid, and some tips:
- Norway is quite wet late August. Plan accordingly, I did not. 
- Note that a motorcycle chain wears (and stretches) faster at the end of its lifespan. For goodness's sake, go with fresh tires and a properly serviced clutch and chain. 
- While some ferry's run quite frequently, others do not. Check the schedule beforehand.
- Sign up for a [AutoPass](https://www.autopass.no/en/) account to make tolls easier.
