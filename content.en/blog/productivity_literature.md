I primarily read non-fiction, and therefore also read some books that are about productivity, habits, and you could say fall into the dreaded 'self-help' category. I find some books better than others, and I thought it would be nice to make a list and give a reason why I think some books are worth reading.

- **Atomic Habits** by James Clear
	- I believe this book to be quite overhyped. Most of its actually useful content can be summarized a few pages. However, it does a good job of explaining how habits work, and gives some practical tips on how to build good habits and break bad ones. For me, it did not provide any insights into how one can actually **do the work**, but rather how to set up your life in a way that makes it easier.
- **Deep Work** by Cal Newport
	- I could definitely not find myself in the practical strategy's he proposes, nor the philosophy behind it (the whole shallow work vs deep work dichotomy). 
- **hyper focus** by Chris Bailey
	- Is in the same street as Deep Work, and both are doing what atomic habits does for habits, but for focus, in a worse way. I don't think either book actually provides a way to actually focus better. They both just explain why focus is important, and give some practical tips on how to set up your environment to make it easier to focus. But neither actually helps you with the actual act of focusing.
- **De kunst van Kaizen** by Robert Maurer
	- Another book about habits, but with a different approach. It focuses on the idea of how to actually make those small crucial changes that lead to big results over time. It emphasizes the importance of taking small steps, and how to overcome the fear of change. I found it incredibly practical and the information to be presented in a dense way, which is something I appreciate, as other books tend to be quite fluffy. 
- **4000 Weeks** by Oliver Burkeman
	- This book was quite an eye-opener for me. It made me realize that time management is a fool's errand, and that trying to do everything is a recipe for unhappiness. I read it after the other books, and I think it broke down a lot of the ideas I had about productivity and time management that I thought were true. I really enjoyed the philosophical approach of the book, and it made me rethink my approach to productivity.
- **7 Habits of Highly Effective People** by Stephen Covey
	- I have this book on the to-read list, but have not read it yet. Judging from my new perspective on productivity, I am not sure if I will read it anytime soon. As far as I know, it does seem like quite an overhyped book as well.
- **Thinking, fast and slow** by Daniel Kahneman
	- While not strictly a productivity book, it does provide insights into how our minds work, and how we can make better decisions. It is quite dense, and I am about halfway. It is a good book, but I am not sure if I can keep my 'slow thinking' hat on for the entire book.

So yea, read 4000 weeks if you want to rethink your approach to productivity. Read De kunst van Kaizen if you want practical tips on how to build habits. The other books are not worth your time in my opinion.
