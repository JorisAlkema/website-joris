**Hi, I'm [Joris Alkema].** 

I am a student and sport fanatic. I currently live in Leiden where I am a last year master student in Computer Science. I am a bad 5K runner and probably a worse swimmer.

This blog is mainly to document my life and structure my thoughts, and I have a lot of other intrests i'd like to write about. In practise, this blog will be a mess.

I have been working as a freelancer as a system administrator, but rencently have taken on a ML operations / cloud engineering job, and hope to expand into ML engineering in the future as well.

Curious about my work? check my resume for all the nitty-gritty details.
